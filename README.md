# Emotion Detection Project

This is my 3rd grade deep learning class project. I've trained lots of deep learning models to
detect emotion in the picture using transfer learning. The models I've tried:

- Inception V4
- MobileNet
- NasNetLarge
- Resnet50
- Resnet101
- VGG16 and VGG19
- XCeption

In 16 December 2021, I tried to refactor the code, but I'm not working on CV projects anymore. \
Feel free to contribute if you want.
